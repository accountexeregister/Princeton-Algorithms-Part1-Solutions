# Princeton-Algorithms-Part1-Solutions
My solutions to the programming assignments in "Algorithms, Part I" by Princeton University.

## About
["Algorithms, Part I" by Princeton University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.  

This repository contains solutions to all the programming assignments, where I have achieve 100% grade for each of them.  

## Percolation  
This programming assignment requires the implementation of percolation. The specification for this assignment is [here](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php).  
The solution is [here](percolation).  

## Deques and Randomized Queues  
This programming assignment requires the writing of a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The specification for this assignment is [here](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php).  
The solution is [here](queues).  

## Collinear Points  
This programming assignment requires the writing of a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points. The specification for this assignment is [here](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php).  
The solution is [here](collinear).  

## 8 Puzzle  
This programming assignment requires the writing of a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm. The specification for this assignment is [here](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle/specification.php).  
The solution is [here](8puzzle).  

## Kd-Trees 
This programming assignment requires the writing of a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point). The specification for this assignment is [here](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree/specification.php).  
The solution is [here](kdtree).
